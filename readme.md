# leadhorse

Sometimes you need a name for something, but don't care what it is. This program creates fake words by combining two
randomly-selected words from a list of words.

## Usage

You can run this program using node:

```Shell
node leadhorse.js
```

The list of words used to generate fake words is in `words.json`.
